Spring 2020
I see a dance floor with groups of people moving around, it’s a party where nothing is standing still.

In the blue area I see jumbled up music notes.

Spring 2020
Knowing the artist had been in the war, I see a soldier’s trek across lands through the seasons in the painting. The red circle in the top left corner seems like the sun. It is a starting point connected by the wavy line to hills. The blue section forms a scenery of hills during a clear day in the spring. Below it it looks like sandy hills on a hot summer day, the warm colors remind me of a desert or some barren land. Even the wavy line within the more muted, greyish-blue section looks like hills in a cold winter scene.
